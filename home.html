		<div id="about" class="about">
			<p>Lauren was born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona by Robin and Terry. She has an older sister, Dana, and graduated from Shadow Mountain High School in 2004. She went to Arizona Statue University, where she studied journalism, and like David, was heavily involved in campus activities &#8212; giving campus tours, enjoying her sorority, Chi Omega, and serving as President of the Programming and Activities Board. Lauren graduated summa cum laude from Barrett the Honors College, and went on to get her master&#39;s degree from the University of California, Berkeley in Public Policy. Following graduate school, Lauren consulted for the Pew Charitable Trust before beginning her ongoing adventure at LivingSocial. </p>
			<p>David was born in Huron, South Dakota by Dick and Suzanne. He has two younger brothers, Kevin and Brian, and graduated with the Huron High School Class of 2003. He attended college at Arizona State University (ASU) where he graduated summa cum laude with dual bachelors of science degrees in finance and economics. While at ASU, he and his good friend Alan Clifford started a mildly successful IT consulting and sales company focused on college students, University Geeks. After graduating, he joined The Boeing Company where he completed a corporate finance leadership rotation program and rounded out his four years with the firm working on the B-1 bomber program in southern California. During this time, David also completed his MBA at the University of Southern California. Seeking an opportunity to rejoin his good friend Alan Clifford, David took a position with LivingSocial in Washington, DC and over the past three and a half years has enjoyed the opportunity to be a part of an amazing experience. </p>

	<div class="proposal">
			<p>Lauren has a group of friends that she travels with twice a year - Bonnie, Jenny, Andrew, Drew and Neal (pictured in her bridal party below). They were on a friends trip in Charleston, South Carolina and David had them all in on a big surprise. They went to Kiawah Island, outside of Charleston, to check out the beach (or so Lauren thought). <br><br>When they arrived, they headed straight to the boardwalk, and as they approached, Lauren saw a banner with her name on it that read "Lauren, Our Story." At the entrance to the boardwalk were Lauren's favorite flowers, a card from David and an iPod. Before Lauren opened the card she was already crying. On the iPod was a recorded message from David, telling her how the boardwalk represented their relationship over the past 7 years. David had lined the board walk with handmade canvases showcasing their photos, memories and trips. He had their favorite songs playing on the iPod as she walked down the boardwalk and reflected on their history together.<br><br> The last easel had photos of their parents and grandparents on their wedding days. They too had recorded messages to Lauren that she got to listen to, where they expressed their love, support and blessings for both her and David. Then, at the end of the boardwalk was David. He had carved a heart in the sand, and stood their with their dog Winnie (who was dressed a wedding dress). He got down on one knee, they embraced, and celebrated afterward with several of their closest friends for the rest of the weekend.</p>

		<p>Family and friends will celebrate Lauren and David's nuptials in a historic Arizona landmark, Old Main. The building was constructed in 1885 before Arizona achieved statehood, and was originally dedicated in 1898. Old Main is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was the first building in Tempe wired for electric lighting. President Teddy Roosevelt dedicated the Roosevelt Dam from the front stairway in 1911. Old Main currently houses the Alumni Association and Lauren actually worked in Old Main the summer after graduating from ASU, before heading to graduate school.</p>
